## Current Cookbooks

[Scott's Cookbook](https://cookbook.scottpopplewell.me/)
[Hillas Family Cookbook](https://cookbookhillasfamilycommain.gatsbyjs.io/)

## Architecture

The site is a [Gatsby JS](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) static site powered by a Contentful CMS organization. When new features are delivered or content updated, the site gets rebuilt on Gatsby Cloud and redeployed. During the build, the Contentful API is queried and the static site pages are constructed, so the entire site is just a collection of HTML, CSS + JS with no server-side integrations, making for a very fast user experience.
