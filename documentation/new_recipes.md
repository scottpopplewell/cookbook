# Adding a New Recipe

The recipes are adding and stored in a Contentful organization. Contentful is a Content Management System (CMS) that supports all different kinds of content from ecommerce sites to personal blogs. We're using it to store all of our recipes + comments. Ask your cookbook admin to [add you to the Contentful organization](./adding_new_users.md).
