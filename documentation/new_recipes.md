# Adding a New Recipe

The recipes are adding and stored in a Contentful organization. Contentful is a Content Management System (CMS) that supports all different kinds of content from ecommerce sites to personal blogs. We're using it to store all of our recipes + comments. Ask your cookbook admin to [add you to the Contentful organization](./adding_new_users.md).

## Easy Mode — Just Pictures!

A lot of the recipes we enjoy are already written down somewhere maybe on a recipe card or in a physical cookbook. If you'd like to quickly add a recipe to your cookbook, you just need:

- A recipe title (E.g. "Vintage Chocolate Custard")
- The author
- A serving size (E.g. "1 pint")
- A short description (E.g. "My favorite chocolate custard")
- A few images, snapped from your phone!

### 1 — [Log into Contentful and navigate to the Content Tab](https://app.contentful.com/spaces/kk2euocn6y07/entries)
### 2 — Click on the "Add Entry" button near the top right to start a new recipe entry
### 3 — Fill out the title, author, serving size, short description
### 4 — Add your images*

- When you get to the "Images" section of the new entry page, you'll see a "Add Media" button.
- Click on the button and select "Add new media"
- This will take you to a new page to add an image to Contentful.
    - Title the image — Not very important what the title is. The title will only be displayed in Contentful and not on the cookbook
    - Add an image — Click on "Open File Selector" and choose the photo you would like to add

*Easiest when adding images straight from your phone!

### 5 — Publish!

Click on the big green "Publish Changes" button on the right side of the page
